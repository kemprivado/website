      <p>God is my passion. I am not religious, i just love god. My religion is christianity, but it's not the way everyone portrays it as. I used to never like going to church, I believed in god, but the service was just boring. So they made a youth service, where all the highschoolers go and have their servie. I decided to voulenteer there, and it was amazing. I am a host, so when all the kids come in, me and two others entertain them for a bit, we share a story, crack some jokes, we basically set the mood. The we get into the game, we play all sorts of games, From sherades, to "everything is sexy" it's pretty lit, then we let them chill for like 10 minutes to talk amungst eachother, and after that is when we get into the message. Our pastor is chill, you would expect some dude in like a suit, nope he has a fly outfit, wears a hat, has tattos. We stress to come as you are, the way you look does not describe your relationship with god. He speaks very modern, because in the regular service (spanish) the kids would get boring, because the pastor can't relate to us young folks. So he is pretty young so he relates to us. I love god because you don't have to fit a certain standard, When I tell people that im christian, they are surprised because they see my piercings, the music i listen to, the way i talk/dress. we say come as you are and he will love you. We make being christian fun, we want to get more of the youth involved with the church, what better way then showing them god can be fun.</p>

      <p>oh man, coding is so much fun. Iv'e been coding for about a year now, and i just love it. You get to create sometjing, out of nothing. Not a lot of fields are like that. Just typing away, knowing your code is correct, gives me a rush of adrenaline. When I have a bug in my code, and i spend hours trying to make my code work, I love it. I know it should be annoying, but i love it. Because once you find that bug, and you get your code working, oh my it's amazing. My Dream  is to be able to work or a tech company just coding away, or make a billion dollar app, either or :)</p>
